next steps:

Update: could not resolve issue involving camelot-py and ghostscript (GS coult not find shared library - libgs.so - on my system, but it worked in previous versions). To resolve this, I see two possible approaches:
	- create a VM with a previous Ubuntu version (<20.04) and try to make this work
	- or give up on using Camelot and try tabula-py (even though the lattice flavor of camelot produces the best results I know... :/ )

URGENT:
	- layout: could not install and use camelot successfully. Try alternatives (like tabula-py) or create a standard procedure to install camelot and its dependencies.
	  (p.s.: didn't work with tabula)
	
	- create standard code inside if __name__ == "__main__" block
	
IMPROVEMENTS:
	- make paths portable to different OS usint pathlib
	- modularize code into .py file 
	- pass arguments to it via terminal (example: python file.py --argument)
	- create user interface
